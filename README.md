# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
Fictional office members Basil and project mentor Sadhana have assigned a project focusing on collecting and displaying earthquake data. Now, they would like to see earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, as well as all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5, and the data on a map. A map has been created and populated with GeoJSON data focusing on earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 or higher. Each earthquake is represented with a unique color and circle size dependent on its magnitude. 

### GeoJSON Data
Earthquakes with 4.5+ magnitude in the past 7 days: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson
Tectonic Plates Data: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json
