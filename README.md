# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
Fictional office members Basil and project mentor Sadhana have assigned a project focusing on collecting and displaying earthquake data. Now, they would like to see earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates’ location on the earth, as well as all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5, and the data on a map. A map has been created and populated with GeoJSON data focusing on earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 or higher. Each earthquake is represented with a unique color and circle size dependent on its magnitude. 

### GeoJSON Data
[Earthquakes with 4.5+ magnitude in the past 7 days](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson)
